# Template-PMU-App
This template, based on NI Labview's [Continuous Measurement and Logging](http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/14031/en/), was developed to help you develop PMU applications using [S3DK](https://github.com/ALSETLab/S3DK) to access real-time synchrophasor measurements.
It provides a simple framework where the data management and other common interactions are already implemented, where the developer can easily plug in his algorithm.

## Create your Own PMU App
You can use this template to create your own PMU application based on [S3DK](https://github.com/ALSETLab/S3DK).
Simply clone the project on your own computer to get started.

**NOTE**: The project includes a GIT submodule in its dependencies that you should be initiated upon cloning the repository.
Usually, you can tick a box in the advanced settings to do a **recursive** cloning of the repo (e.g. 'recurse submodules' in SourceTree)

## Functionalities implemented
The following functionalities are implemented in the template:

 1. Automated PMU data aquisition through the S3DK
 2. Configurable PMU data buffering for parallel algorithms
 3. User settings management
 4. User configurable error handling
